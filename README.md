# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-Collaborative-Filtering-
 This project focuses on building a movie recommendation engine that suggests films to users based on past behavior. 



Approach: Collaborative Filtering
We utilize a collaborative filtering technique, generating recommendations based on user similarities. In other words:

Users are recommended movies that other users with similar tastes have liked in the past.
This method predicts unknown ratings by analyzing patterns in user preferences.
